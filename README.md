#### Features

- *Customizable Styles*: The gallery is styled with basic CSS, making it easy to customize further according to personal preferences or project requirements.
- *Minimalist Design*: The background is set to black, highlighting the images and creating a clean, modern look.

#### How to Use

1. *Clone or Download the Repository*: Get the code onto your local machine.
2. *Add Your Own Images*: Replace the placeholder images (img1.jpg, img2.jpg, etc.) with your own images in the same folder.
3. *Open index.html*: Simply open the index.html file in any web browser to view the image gallery in action.
